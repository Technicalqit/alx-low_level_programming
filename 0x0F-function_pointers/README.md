## 0x0F. C - Function pointers
 
# In C, we can use function pointers to avoid code redundancy. For example a simple qsort() function can be used to sort arrays in ascending order or descending or by any other order in case of array of structures. Not only this, with function pointers and void pointers, it is possible to use qsort for any data type.
